# using EHRs to question maternal thyroid function and ASD link

- brain anatomy linked to autism is present at birth

- thyroid hormones play key role in brain development

--

#### Q 1: is hypothyroidism associated with inc. risk of autism (430k births) ?
#### Q 2: does risk for medicated mothers differ from Q1 risk ? 
#### Q 3: does risk for lab-tested medicated mothers differ from Q1 and Q2 risks ? 
#### Q 4: are levels of TSH/fT4 associated with inc. risk of autism (50k births) ? 

--

> Results indicate that maternal thyroid conditions are associated with increased ASD risk in progeny, but suggestively not due to direct effects of thyroid hormones. Instead, factors that influence maternal thyroid function could have etiologic roles in ASD through pathways independent of maternal gestational thyroid hormones and thus be unaffected by medication treatment. Factors known to disrupt thyroid function should be examined for possible involvement in ASD etiology.

[OpenSAFELY: the origin story](https://www.bennett.ox.ac.uk/blog/2021/05/opensafely-the-origin-story/)


.vsmall[.pull-left[
> On 7th May 2020, the OpenSAFELY Collaborative pre-printed the worldâ€™s largest study into factors associated with death from Covid-19, based on an analysis running across the full pseudonymised health records of 40% of the English population. This is an unprecedented scale of data.
>
> ... a huge collaboration including the Bennett Institute for Applied Data Science at the University of Oxford, the EHR research group at London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, NHS England, and TPP. Over 42 days during the peak of the first wave of COVID-19 this team worked day and night to produce a fully open-source, privacy-preserving software platform, capable of running open and reproducible analytics across electronic health records, all held securely in situ. Since then the OpenSAFELY platform has expanded to a full scale analytic environment for secure data analysis, reproducible data curation, federated analysis, and code sharing, with every line of code for the platform, for data management, and for data analysis .red[all shared openly by default, in re-usable forms, automatically, and without exception.]

- London Travel Demand Survey, trip route simulation

> Exposure to outdoor air pollution was provided by CMAQ-urban, which couples the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) meteorological model, the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) regional scale model, and the Atmospheric Dispersion Modeling System (ADMS) roads model

- I/O ratio for indoor air levels

- for in-vehicle levels: $\frac{dC_{in}}{dt}=\lambda_{in}(C_{out}-C_{in})-n\lambda _{HVAV}\cdot C_{in}-V_{g}(\frac {A^{*}}{V})\cdot C_{in}+\frac {Q}{V}$
