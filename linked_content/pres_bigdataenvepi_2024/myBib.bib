	abstract = {Here we describe the development of the London Hybrid Exposure Model (LHEM), which calculates exposure of the Greater London population to outdoor air pollution sources, in-buildings, in-vehicles, and outdoors, using survey data of when and where people spend their time. For comparison and to estimate exposure misclassiﬁcation we compared Londoners LHEM exposure with exposure at the residential address, a commonly used exposure metric in epidemiological research. In 2011, the mean annual LHEM exposure to outdoor sources was estimated to be 37\% lower for PM2.5 and 63\% lower for NO2 than at the residential address. These decreased estimates reﬂect the eﬀects of reduced exposure indoors, the amount of time spent indoors (∼95\%), and the mode and duration of travel in London. We ﬁnd that an individual’s exposure to PM2.5 and NO2 outside their residential address is highly correlated (Pearson’s R of 0.9). In contrast, LHEM exposure estimates for PM2.5 and NO2 suggest that the degree of correlation is inﬂuenced by their exposure in diﬀerent transport modes. Further development of the LHEM has the potential to increase the understanding of exposure error and bias in time-series and cohort studies and thus better distinguish the independent eﬀects of NO2 and PM2.5.},

	abstract = {Epidemiological studies on the health eﬀects of air pollution usually rely on measurements from ﬁxed ground monitors, which provide limited spatio-temporal coverage. Data from satellites, reanalysis, and chemical transport models oﬀer additional information used to reconstruct pollution concentrations at high spatio-temporal resolutions. This study aims to develop a multi-stage satellite-based machine learning model to estimate daily ﬁne particulate matter (PM2.5) levels across Great Britain between 2008–2018. This high-resolution model consists of random forest (RF) algorithms applied in four stages. Stage-1 augments monitor-PM2.5 series using co-located PM10 measures. Stage-2 imputes missing satellite aerosol optical depth observations using atmospheric reanalysis models. Stage-3 integrates the output from previous stages with spatial and spatio-temporal variables to build a prediction model for PM2.5. Stage-4 applies Stage-3 models to estimate daily PM2.5 concentrations over a 1 km grid. The RF architecture performed well in all stages, with results from Stage-3 showing an average cross-validated R2 of 0.767 and minimal bias. The model performed better over the temporal scale when compared to the spatial component, but both presented good accuracy with an R2 of 0.795 and 0.658, respectively. These ﬁndings indicate that direct satellite observations must be integrated with other satellite-based products and geospatial variables to derive reliable estimates of air pollution exposure. The high spatio-temporal resolution and the relatively high precision allow these estimates (approximately 950 million points) to be used in epidemiological analyses to assess health risks associated with both short- and long-term exposure to PM2.5.},

	abstract = {Background
In the next 25years, transformative changes, in particular the rapid pace of technological development and data availability, will require environmental epidemiologists to prioritize what should (rather than could) be done to most effectively improve population health.
Objectives
In this essay, we map out key driving forces that will shape environmental epidemiology in the next 25years. We also identify how the field should adapt to best take advantage of coming opportunities and prepare for challenges.
Discussion
Future environmental epidemiologists will face a world shaped by longer lifespans but also larger burdens of chronic health conditions; shifting populations by region and into urban areas; and global environmental change. Rapidly evolving technologies, particularly in sensors and OMICs, will present opportunities for the field. How should it respond? We argue, the field best adapts to a changing world by focusing on healthy aging; evidence gaps, especially in susceptible populations and low-income countries; and by developing approaches to better handle complexity and more formalized analysis.
Conclusions
Environmental epidemiology informing disease prevention will continue to be valuable. However, the field must adapt to remain relevant. In particular, the field must ensure that public health importance drives research questions, while seizing the opportunities presented by new technologies. Environmental epidemiologists of the future will require different, refined skills to work effectively across disciplines, ask the right questions, and implement appropriate study designs in a data-rich world.},

From this definition, we argue that Big Data has evolutionary and revolutionary implications for identifying and intervening on the determinants of population health. We suggest that as more sources of diverse data become publicly available, the ability to combine and refine these data to yield valid answers to epidemiologic questions will be invaluable. We conclude that, while epidemiology as practiced today will continue to be practiced in the Big Data future, a component of our field’s future value lies in integrating subject matter knowledge with increased technical savvy. Our training programs and our visions for future public health interventions should reflect this future.},

	abstract = {Clinicians handle a growing amount of clinical, biometric, and biomarker data. In this “big data” era, there is an emerging faith that the answer to all clinical and scientific questions reside in “big data” and that data will transform medicine into precision medicine. However, data by themselves are useless. It is the algorithms encoding causal reasoning and domain (e.g., clinical and biological) knowledge that prove transformative. The recent introduction of (health) data science presents an opportunity to re-think this data-centric view. For example, while precision medicine seeks to provide the right prevention and treatment strategy to the right patients at the right time, its realization cannot be achieved by algorithms that operate exclusively in data-driven prediction modes, as do most machine learning algorithms. Better understanding of data science and its tasks is vital to interpret findings and translate new discoveries into clinical practice. In this review, we first discuss the principles and major tasks of data science by organizing it into three defining tasks: (1) association and prediction, (2) intervention, and (3) counterfactual causal inference. Second, we review commonly-used data science tools with examples in the medical literature. Lastly, we outline current challenges and future directions in the fields of medicine, elaborating on how data science can enhance clinical effectiveness and inform medical practice. As machine learning algorithms become ubiquitous tools to handle quantitatively “big data,” their integration with causal reasoning and domain knowledge is instrumental to qualitatively transform medicine, which will, in turn, improve health outcomes of patients.},

	abstract = {Background: Data measuring airborne pollutants, public health and environmental factors are increasingly being stored and merged. These big datasets offer great potential, but also challenge traditional epidemiological methods. This has motivated the exploration of alternative methods to make predictions, find patterns and extract information. To this end, data mining and machine learning algorithms are increasingly being applied to air pollution epidemiology.
Methods: We conducted a systematic literature review on the application of data mining and machine learning methods in air pollution epidemiology. We carried out our search process in PubMed, the MEDLINE database and Google Scholar. Research articles applying data mining and machine learning methods to air pollution epidemiology were queried and reviewed.
Results: Our search queries resulted in 400 research articles. Our fine-grained analysis employed our inclusion/exclusion criteria to reduce the results to 47 articles, which we separate into three primary areas of interest: 1) source apportionment; 2) forecasting/prediction of air pollution/quality or exposure; and 3) generating hypotheses. Early applications had a preference for artificial neural networks. In more recent work, decision trees, support vector machines, k-means clustering and the APRIORI algorithm have been widely applied. Our survey shows that the majority of the research has been conducted in Europe, China and the USA, and that data mining is becoming an increasingly common tool in environmental health. For potential new directions, we have identified that deep learning and geo-spacial pattern mining are two burgeoning areas of data mining that have good potential for future applications in air pollution epidemiology.
Conclusions: We carried out a systematic review identifying the current trends, challenges and new directions to explore in the application of data mining methods to air pollution epidemiology. This work shows that data mining is increasingly being applied in air pollution epidemiology. The potential to support air pollution epidemiology continues to grow with advancements in data mining related to temporal and geo-spacial mining, and deep learning. This is further supported by new sensors and storage mediums that enable larger, better quality data. This suggests that many more fruitful applications can be expected in the future.},

Epidemiology seems to have reached a limit in disentangling the role of single components in causal complexes, particularly at low doses. To overcome limitations the discipline can take advantage of technical developments including the science of the exposome. By referring to the interpretation of the exposome as put forward in the work of Wild and Rappaport, I show examples of how the science of multi-causality can build upon the developments of omic technologies. Finally, I broaden the picture by advocating a more holistic approach to causality that also encompasses social sciences and the concept of embodiment. To tackle NCDs effectively on one side we can invest in various omic approaches, to identify new external causes of non-communicable diseases (that we can use to develop preventive strategies), and the corresponding mechanistic pathways. On the other side, we need to focus on the social and societal determinants which are suggested to be the root causes of many non-communicable diseases.},

Conversely, there were many examples of epidemiologic studies promoting ineffective interventions and little evident attempt to account for such failure. Major advances in concrete understanding of disease etiology have been driven by a willingness to learn about and incorporate into epidemiology developments in biology and cognate data science disciplines.

	abstract = {Background
The findings of observational studies can be distorted by a number of factors. So-called confounders are well known, but distortion by collider bias (CB) has received little attention in medical research to date. The goal of this article is to present the principle of CB, and measures that can be taken to avoid it, by way of a few illustrative examples.

Methods
The findings of a selective review of the literature on CB are explained with illustrative examples.

Results
The simplest case of a collider variable is one that is caused by at least two other variables. An example of CB is the observation that, among persons with diabetes, obesity is associated with lower mortality, even though it is associated with higher mortality in the general population. The false protective association between obesity and mortality arises from the restriction of the study population to persons with diabetes.

Conclusion
CB is a distortion that arises through restriction on or stratification by a collider variable, or through statistical adjustment for a collider variable in a regression model. CB can arise in many ways. The graphic representation of causal structures helps to identify potential sources of CB. It is important to distinguish confounders from colliders, as methods that serve to correct for confounding can themselves cause bias when applied to colliders. There is no generally applicable method for correcting CB.},

Several Nordic, European, and other multinational collaborations are now well established. Advantages of big data for clinical epidemiology include improved precision of estimates, which is especially important for reassuring (“null”) findings; ability to conduct meaningful analyses in subgroup of patients; and rapid detection of safety signals. Big data will also provide new possibilities for research by enabling access to linked information from biobanks, electronic medical records, patient-reported outcome measures, automatic and semiautomatic electronic monitoring devices, and social media. The sheer amount of data, however, does not eliminate and may even amplify systematic error.

	abstract = {Lack of bias in the estimation of relative effect in epidemiologic studies depends on the internal validity of the study. This paper conveys in graphic and tabular form the direction and magnitude of bias due to misclassification of study subjects. A series of computer-generated graphs shows that the departure of the estimate of effect (relative risk or odds ratio) from its true value is a function of sensitivity and specificity (measures of classification validity), disease frequency, and exposure frequency. The discussion of bias emphasizes misclassification of the "outcome" variable; i.e., disease occurrence in a cohort study and exposure rate in a case-control study. Examples are used to illustrate that the magnitude of the bias can be large under circumstances which occur readily in epidemiologic research. When misclassification is equal for the two compared groups, the estimate is biased toward the null value, and in some instances beyond; when differential misclassification occurs (as in selective recall in case-control studies) the bias can be in either direction, and may be great. Formulas are derived to estimate the underlying true value of the relative risk or odds ratio using the investigator's observations together with the estimated sensitivity and specificity of the classification procedure.},

Netflix knows what movies people like to watch and Google knows what people want to know based on their search histories. Indeed, Google has recently begun to replace much of its existing non–machine learning technology with machine learning algorithms, and there is great optimism that these techniques can provide similar improvements across many sectors.It is no surprise then that medicine is awash with claims of revolution from the application of machine learning to big health care data. Recent examples have demonstrated that big data and machine learning can create algorithms that perform on par with human physicians. Though machine learning and big data may seem mysterious at first, they are in fact deeply related to traditional statistical models that are recognizable to most clinicians. It is our hope that elucidating these connections will demystify these techniques and provide a set of reasonable expectations for the role of machine learning and big data in health care.},

	abstract = {Big data has remarkably evolved over the last few years to realize an enormous volume of data generated from newly emerging services and applications and a massive number of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices. The potential of big data can be realized via analytic and learning techniques, in which the data from various sources is transferred to a central cloud for central storage, processing, and training. However, this conventional approach faces critical issues in terms of data privacy as the data may include sensitive data such as personal information, governments, banking accounts. To overcome this challenge, federated learning (FL) appeared to be a promising learning technique. However, a gap exists in the literature that a comprehensive survey on FL for big data services and applications is yet to be conducted. In this article, we present a survey on the use of FL for big data services and applications, aiming to provide general readers with an overview of FL, big data, and the motivations behind the use of FL for big data. In particular, we extensively review the use of FL for key big data services, including big data acquisition, big data storage, big data analytics, and big data privacy preservation. Subsequently, we review the potential of FL for big data applications, such as smart city, smart healthcare, smart transportation, smart grid, and social media. Further, we summarize a number of important projects on FL-big data and discuss key challenges of this interesting topic along with several promising solutions and directions.},

Here we used OpenSAFELY to examine factors associated with COVID-19-related death. Primary care records of 17,278,392 adults were pseudonymously linked to 10,926 COVID-19-related deaths. COVID-19-related death was associated with: being male (hazard ratio (HR) 1.59 (95\% confidence interval 1.53–1.65)); greater age and deprivation (both with a strong gradient); diabetes; severe asthma; and various other medical conditions. Compared with people of white ethnicity, Black and South Asian people were at higher risk, even after adjustment for other factors (HR 1.48 (1.29–1.69) and 1.45 (1.32–1.58), respectively). We have quantified a range of clinical factors associated with COVID-19-related death in one of the largest cohort studies on this topic so far.

	doi = {10.1097/EDE.0000000000001174},
	abstract = {Background: 
          Maternal thyroid dysfunction is suspected of causing adverse neurodevelopmental effects, but current evidence is inconclusive. Epidemiologic investigations generally suggest an association between maternal thyroid dysfunction and neurodevelopment impairments in progeny, but clinical trials of thyroid treatment during pregnancy reported null effects. To better understand these discrepant findings, we evaluated the association between maternal thyroid conditions and autism spectrum disorder (ASD), including examining the role of gestational thyroid-related hormone concentrations and thyroid medications use.
          Methods: 
          Analyses considered 437,222 singleton live births occurring in a large Israeli health fund in 1999–2013, followed through 2016. Thyroid conditions and ASD cases were identified through International Classification of Diseases-9 codes with subsequent validation through review of medical records. Laboratory gestational thyroid hormone measurements were also considered.
          Results: 
          Children of mothers who ever experienced hypothyroidism had a higher risk of ASD compared with children of mothers without hypothyroidism (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.26, 95\% confidence interval [CI] = 1.12, 1.42). The association with hyperthyroidism was less consistent, but elevated in main analyses (aOR = 1.42, 95\% CI = 1.04, 1.94). These associations were not explained by maternal gestational thyroid hormones levels nor mitigated by gestational use of thyroid medications.
          Conclusions: 
          Results indicate that maternal thyroid conditions are associated with increased ASD risk in progeny, but suggestively not due to direct effects of thyroid hormones. Instead, factors that influence maternal thyroid function could have etiologic roles in ASD through pathways independent of maternal gestational thyroid hormones and thus be unaffected by medication treatment. Factors known to disrupt thyroid function should be examined for possible involvement in ASD etiology.},
